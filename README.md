# Image Enhancement and Quality Assessment
This project focuses on enhancing low-light images and assessing the quality of the enhanced images using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metric.

# Introduction
Low-light image enhancement is a crucial task in image processing, aiming to improve the visibility of images taken in poor lighting conditions. This project applies an illumination refinement algorithm and BM3D denoising to enhance images, and calculates PSNR to measure the quality of the enhanced images.
